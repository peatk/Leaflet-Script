# Leaflet Script Project

### Background
The United States Geological Survey (USGS) plays a pivotal role in gathering and disseminating critical scientific data concerning natural hazards, environmental health, and the impacts of climate change. In line with their mission, the USGS is embarking on a project to develop innovative tools for visualizing earthquake data, aiming to enhance public awareness and inform governmental organizations. This project seeks to address the deficiency in meaningful display mechanisms for the vast amounts of earthquake data collected worldwide on a daily basis. I was tasked with creating a solution that effectively visualizes USGS earthquake data, enabling better public education and potentially aiding in securing additional funding for crucial Earth-related initiatives.
